# LAB-1
Explore Azure Synapse Analytics

This repository contains the hands-on implementation of the "Explore Azure Synapse Analytics" lab, a learning module from Microsoft Learn. The main goal of this assignment is to explore and understand the core features of Azure Synapse Analytics, a powerful data integration and big data analytics service provided by Microsoft Azure.

üéØ Objective
The objective of this lab is to gain practical experience with Azure Synapse Analytics by provisioning a Synapse workspace, ingesting sample datasets, and using different components (SQL, Spark, and Dedicated SQL pool) for data exploration and analysis.

By the end of this assignment, learners should be able to:

Set up a Synapse Analytics environment

Load and explore data using OneLake

Use serverless SQL and Apache Spark to analyze datasets

Run queries on a dedicated SQL pool

Understand how Synapse integrates with data lakes and supports hybrid analytical workloads

üìÅ What‚Äôs Included in This Project?
The following key steps were completed as part of the assignment:

Provisioning the Azure Synapse Workspace
Creating the Synapse workspace and linking it to required storage accounts.

Ingesting Data into OneLake
Uploading sample data (CSV and Parquet files) to OneLake using Synapse Studio.

Exploring Data with Serverless SQL
Using T-SQL queries to examine and transform raw data directly from the data lake.

Analyzing Data with Apache Spark
Running Spark notebooks to perform distributed data processing and analytics.

Querying with Dedicated SQL Pool
Loading and querying structured data to experience performance-optimized analytics.
